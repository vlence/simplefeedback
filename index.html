                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                
                <p>
                        If you want to collect feedback from your users you'd typically provide some kind
                        of form that would require the user to describe, in detail, what was expected and
                        what went wrong. This is pretty standard and is used across the industry. Sometimes
                        it may not be so easy to describe it in words so affordances like image/video upload
                        are made.
                </p>

                <p>
                        Videos are probably the most useful as you can see, and maybe hear, what the problem
                        is. The downside of videos are their size and the fact that you need to watch them in
                        their entirety to fully understand what is the problem. Screenshots have their own
                        problems. Users often need to highlight part(s) of the picture to make clear what
                        they're talking about. Most users wouldn't bother with that. And last but not least,
                        language. The user simply may not know how to articulate the problem clearly.
                </p>

                <p>The problem is two-fold:</p>

                <ul>
                        <li>How do we make it easy for the user to communicate the problem?</li>
                        <li>How do we make it easy for the debugger to understand the problem?</li>
                </ul>

                                        A dialog pops up asking for feedback! You can now use this form to tell the
                                        website owner how frustrated you are about the spelling mistake.

                                <div class="preview"></div>

                                <div>
                                        <button type="reset">Cancel</button>
                                        <button type="submit">Submit</button>

                <p>
                        Websites are simply a tree of DOM nodes. We can click them. I propose if we allow
                        the user to simply click at what's frustrating them in the page then half the
                        confusion is resolved. Let's try it out. Click on "Toggle feedback mode".
                </p>

                <p>
                        <label class="feedback-mode-toggle">
                                <input type="checkbox">
                                Toggle feedback mode
                        </label>
                </p>

                <p>
                        The following paragraph has a spelling mistake. It irks you. You must let the website
                        owner know that there is a spelling mistake on the website. You might have noticed
                        that the cursor changed into a crosshair after toggling "feedback mode".
                        Click the paragraph below.
                </p>

                <p class="fb-target">
                        This line has an intentional seplling mistake.
                </p>

                <p>
                        If you're reading this I trust you have gone through the exercise of toggling feedback
                        mode and clicking on the paragraph below. This simple example demonstrates that we can
                        precisely target the part of the page that the user wants to provide feedback on and
                        present a feedback form with a preview of what the user clicked on. We don't need to
                        limit ourselves to textual input from the user; screenshots, videos and audio clips
                        can be integrated too. The ability to click on a specific part of the page provides
                        much more context for both the user and the debugger.
                </p>
